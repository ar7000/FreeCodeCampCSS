# FreeCodeCampCSS

Revisiting CSS via FreeCodeCamp resources and copying passed code to Git repo as I go through each task. Documenting below anything new I learn, or anything I am reminded of that I may have forgotten.

- Learned use of attribute selectors.
- Gained further understanding of overriding body element and class declarations, particularly:
    - Last-declared class declaration with take precedence over anything declared above it.
    - ID declarations always take precedence over class declarations, regardless of their position in style sheet.
- Gained further understaning of the structure of hex codes and their relatoon to RGB, i.e. #RRGGBB.
- Learned basic use of CSS variables:
    - Creating a variable.
    - Using variable within an element.
    - Attaching a fallback should the variable not be found.
